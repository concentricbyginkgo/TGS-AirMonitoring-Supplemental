### Abstract
Early detection of outbreaks and emerging pathogens  is critical for public health and global biosecurity. Airports, as major global travel hubs with dense, enclosed populations, are high-risk environments for disease transmission and potential pathogen  entry points. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention collaborated with Ginkgo Biosecurity and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to implement air monitoring pathogen surveillance in congregate areas at four U.S. international airports. From October 2023 to August 2024, SARS-CoV-2 was detected by PCR in 98.3% of air samples, and Influenza A was detected in 17.2% of air samples. These results correlate to positivity trends amongst other sample modalities, including aviation wastewater, traveler nasal swab, and national clinical surveillance data. Targeted amplicon sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in air samples correlated with contemporaneous lineages found in wastewater samples collected and sequenced from the same airports. Metagenomic enrichment sequencing of air samples successfully detected 30 viral species and recovered high quality genomes for SARS-CoV-2, influenza, bocavirus, and seasonal coronaviruses. These findings suggest that air sampling is a complementary modality to aviation wastewater surveillance for early pathogen detection at ports of entry.
